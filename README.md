## Intro ##
The goal of Apartment 101 is to help people shop for a first apartment based on income level and apartment features. The American Consumer Credit Counseling organization advocates that 35 percent of your gross income should go toward your housing and debt service [[1]](https://www.quicken.com/taking-inventory-your-personal-finances-how-much-your-paycheck-should-you-budget-bills-s). Apartment 101 calculates a recommended range for rent based on annual income and debt, which it then uses to search for available units. Apartment listings have been scraped from Apartments.com based on location and desired rent using a modified version of Adina Stoica's scraper found here [[2]](https://github.com/adinutzyc21/apartments-scraper). Once a user starts selecting potential apartments, further recommendations are provided based on similarities to the original selections.
