## Intro ##
The goal of Apartment 101 is to help people shop for a first apartment based on income level and apartment features. The American Consumer Credit Counseling organization advocates that 35 percent of your gross income should go toward your housing and debt service [[1]](https://www.quicken.com/taking-inventory-your-personal-finances-how-much-your-paycheck-should-you-budget-bills-s). Apartment has been scraped from Apartments.com with a modified version of Adina Stoica's scraper [[2]](https://github.com/adinutzyc21/apartments-scraper).
